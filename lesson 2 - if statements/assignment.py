# Minecraft Example

# create a variable called health with a value of 100

# make another variable called arrow with a value of 10

# make another variable called armor that is either true or fales, you choose

# now let's pretend that you got hit by an arrow and now you need to subtract
# the arrow value from your health. But if you have armor you will only take
# half the damage. Make an if statement that will subtract the right amount of
# health and then print your new health value.
