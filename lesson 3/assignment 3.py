# Queston 1
# write a for loop that goes from 1 to 10 and prints those values
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

# Question 2
# using the loop you made in question 1, add an if statement
# so that if the value is less than 5 it prints out "less than five",
# and if it's equal or greater than 5 prints out "greater than five"
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i < 5:
        print('less than five')
    else:
        print('greater than five')
