# Problem 1 - If you take the numbers from 0 to 10 and sum seperatly the odds
# and evens you get you 25 for the odd and 30 for the even.
# find and print out the sums of odd and even numbers from 0 to 100.


# Problem 2 - write a program that asks a user for their name and age.
# Then have it print out "hello <name>, you're really young" if their age is
# 15 or less, and "hello <name>, you're really experenced" if they are older.


# Problem 3 - If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
# of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


# Problem 4 - Take the list [8, 4, 39, 6 ,10, 2, 49] and write a program that
# will print the list but sorted in accending order.


# Problem 5 - Make a program that will ask you for a three characters (e.g., XLF)
# then have it loop through all the combinations until it finds yours.
# have it print out each guess.
