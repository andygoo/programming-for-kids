# logic statements

# a big part of programming is testing conditions
# is x equal to y?, is Jared older than Alison?, is it cold AND raining outside?


# to ask if things are equal we use a double = sign '=='
var_1 = 15
var_2 = 30

print(var_1 == var_2)

# we can also ask if one variable is larger or smaller than another variable
print(var_1 > var_2)

# what happens here?
print(var_2 > var_2)

# we can combine < with = to test if a variable is less than or equal to another variable
print(var_2 >= var_2)
print(var_2 <= var_2)

# we don't have to have the variable there
